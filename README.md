# Custom Printf Function

This code provides a custom implementation of the `printf` function in C. The custom implementation is named `My_Printf` and can be used as a drop-in replacement for the standard `printf` function.

## Usage

To use the custom `printf` function, include the provided code in your C program. The `My_Printf` function takes a format string as its first argument, followed by a variable number of arguments. The format string contains placeholders for the arguments, which are replaced by the corresponding values when the function is called.
